# Personal-Tracker

## Overview
This financial planner project is tailored to benefit students. Key features include real-time stock portfolio tracking and personalized spending advice based on user-defined goals, all accessible with a click of a button.

## How It Works
The application features a starting page where you can set your financial goals and log daily expenses. Over time, such as a month, you can track your progress and identify areas for improvement using the advice page. The advice page serves as a smart calculator that analyzes your spending patterns, needs, and other factors to provide actionable suggestions. You can filter your spending data by selecting specific dates to view targeted insights. The dashboard offers a comprehensive view of your expenses, highlighting trends and uncovering spending habits you might not have been aware of.
